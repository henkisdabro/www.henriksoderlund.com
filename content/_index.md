## Hello! 👋🏼

I’m Henrik Söderlund, Media Activations Lead – [Initiative](https://initiative.com/) Perth via [KINESSO](https://kinesso.com), part of the [Interpublic Group](https://www.interpublic.com/). As the former founder and technical lead of the award-winning boutique media agency [Creme Digital](https://www.cremedigital.com?utm_source=www.henriksoderlund.com&utm_medium=referral) I bring comprehensive expertise in building and leading high-performance teams across Addressable (Programmatic) and Performance advertising channels. My distinctive edge lies in advanced ad performance tracking, measurement architecture, and server-side tagging/analytics implementation.

Swedish-born with optimization in my DNA, I've consistently delivered innovative solutions through custom agency performance tracking systems, streamlined operational processes, and effective SOPs. My versatile technology and systems proficiency enables precise management of multi-million dollar annual media budgets while maintaining exceptional resource efficiency and cost control.
